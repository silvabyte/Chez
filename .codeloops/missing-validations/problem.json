  },
  "problemStatement": "ScalaSchemaz (Chez) library has incomplete validation infrastructure preventing production adoption. The core JSON Schema validation functionality is missing across multiple layers: web request validation (CaskChez), complex schema types (ObjectChez, composition schemas), and schema-driven data validation. This creates a gap between schema generation capabilities and runtime validation, limiting the library's utility for real-world applications that need both schema definition and data validation.",
  "why": "Without proper validation, users cannot leverage Chez schemas for runtime data validation, making the library primarily useful for documentation generation rather than full schema-driven development. This limits adoption for API development, data processing pipelines, and configuration validation use cases. The missing validation creates a fundamental disconnect between compile-time schema generation and runtime data verification, preventing users from building robust, schema-validated applications.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "✅ All primitive Chez schema types can validate ujson.Value data against their constraints",
    "CaskChez can validate HTTP requests (body, params, query, headers) against RouteSchema definitions",
    "Complex composition schemas (AnyOf, OneOf, AllOf, Not, IfThenElse) provide meaningful validation",
    "ObjectChez validates nested object properties recursively against their schemas",
    "✅ Validation errors provide clear, actionable feedback with proper JSON path information",
    "ValidatedReadWriter performs actual schema validation before deserialization",
    "✅ Validation performance supports production workloads (sub-millisecond for simple schemas)",
    "✅ Core validation infrastructure has comprehensive test coverage"
  ],
  "constraints": {
    "technical": "Must maintain JSON Schema 2020-12 compliance, preserve existing API compatibility, work with ujson.Value type system, support compile-time schema derivation, handle recursive schema validation without stack overflow",
    "business": "Cannot break existing users who rely on schema generation, must provide migration path for existing validation logic, should follow functional programming patterns consistent with Scala ecosystem",
    "scope": "Focus on core validation functionality first, then web framework integration. Includes primitive types, complex types, composition schemas, and CaskChez integration. Does not include custom format validation, advanced JSON Schema features like dependencies, or performance optimizations beyond basic requirements",
    "nonGoals": "Not implementing custom validation DSL, not changing schema generation APIs, not adding new schema types, not implementing JSON Schema draft compatibility beyond 2020-12, not optimizing for extreme performance scenarios, not adding validation caching or memoization"
