{"id":"Chez-9oj","title":"Create VercelAIGatewayProvider for structured outputs with Anthropic models","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current OpenAICompatibleProvider uses the OpenAI-specific `response_format: { type: 'json_schema', json_schema: {...} }` format for structured outputs. This format is NOT supported by Anthropic models through the Vercel AI Gateway, causing 400 errors:\n\n```\n{\"error\":{\"message\":\"Invalid input\",\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"param\":\"response_format\"}}\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nCreate a new `VercelAIGatewayProvider` that properly handles structured outputs for different model families available through Vercel AI Gateway.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. Provider Class Structure\n- Create `VercelAIGatewayProvider` extending `BaseLLMProvider`\n- Location: `AI/src/main/scala/boogieloops/Providers/VercelAIGatewayProvider.scala`\n- Default base URL: `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1`\n\n### 2. Model Detection\nDetect model family from model ID prefix to route to appropriate structured output strategy:\n- `openai/` models → Use `response_format: json_schema` (native support)\n- `anthropic/` models → Use tool-based extraction\n- `google/` models → Use response_format if supported, else prompt-based\n- Other models → Fall back to prompt-based JSON extraction\n\n### 3. Structured Output Strategies\n\n#### Strategy A: OpenAI json_schema (for openai/* models)\nUse native `response_format: { type: 'json_schema', json_schema: {...} }`\n\n#### Strategy B: Tool-based extraction (for anthropic/* models)\nUse function calling to extract structured data via tools array with forced tool_choice.\nParse response from `tool_calls[0].function.arguments`\n\n#### Strategy C: Prompt-based JSON (fallback)\nInject schema into system prompt and parse JSON from response content.\n\n### 4. Configuration Options\n- `structuredOutputStrategy: Option[StructuredOutputStrategy]` - Auto, JsonSchema, ToolExtraction, PromptBased\n- `providerOrder: Option[List[String]]` - e.g., List(\"vertex\", \"anthropic\")\n- `modelFallbacks: Option[List[String]]`\n- `enableReasoning: Boolean` with `reasoningConfig`\n\n### 5. Provider Options Support\nSupport Vercel AI Gateway providerOptions for routing and fallbacks.\n\n## Implementation Order\n1. Create base provider class with chat completion support\n2. Implement model family detection\n3. Implement Strategy A (json_schema for OpenAI models)\n4. Implement Strategy B (tool-based for Anthropic models)\n5. Implement Strategy C (prompt-based fallback)\n6. Add provider options support\n7. Write comprehensive tests\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Can use `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` with `generateObject` without errors\n- Can use `openai/gpt-4o-mini` with native json_schema support\n- Falls back gracefully when auto-detection fails\n- All existing tests continue to pass","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-23T14:05:25.195891651-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T14:05:25.195891651-05:00","labels":["ai-provider","enhancement"]}

When the LLM returns slightly malformed JSON (e.g., `null` instead of an empty array, or omitting optional fields unexpectedly), upickle's type argument access fails with `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nThis is **intermittent** because LLM responses vary - the same prompt can produce valid JSON on one run and problematic JSON on another.\n\n## Affected Code\n\n- `AI/src/main/scala/boogieloops/Agent.scala` - lines 253, 370 (`read[T](jsonResponse.data)`)\n- The catch block at lines 283-298 and 394-409\n\n## Suggested Solutions\n\n1. **Add retry logic with exponential backoff** - Retry the LLM call 2-3 times on deserialization failure\n2. **Add specific catch for IndexOutOfBoundsException** - Provide a more descriptive error message\n3. **Pre-validate JSON structure** - Before calling `read[T]`, validate the JSON matches the expected schema\n4. **Log the raw JSON on failure** - Include `jsonResponse.data.render()` in the error message for debugging","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-30T15:05:52.510165579-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T15:05:52.510165579-05:00","labels":["ai","reliability","upickle"]}
