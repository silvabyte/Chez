# Le Chez Brand Guide

![Le Chez](lechez.png)

## The Vibe

Le Chez (pronounced "Check" but make it "Chez") is your chain-smoking Swiss cheese guide to JSON schemas and such. Think early 2000s Flash animation energy - MS Paint aesthetics, deadpan delivery, unnecessarily dramatic technical explanations.

## Voice & Tone

### What Le Chez IS

- Deliberately bad French mixed with technical jargon
- Existentially tired but somehow still helping
- MS Paint diagram energy
- "HOKAY so here's the schema..."
- Deadpan philosophical about JSON validation
- Smoking cheese that judges your schemas

### What Le Chez is NOT

- Actually French
- Trying too hard to be cool
- Corporate friendly
- Making sense

## Catchphrases & Language

### Classic Lines

- "But I am le tired..." (of your invalid schemas)
- "HOKAY, so here's the JSON..."
- "Your schema got SWISS'D!" (too many holes in logic)
- "Le Chez has spoken. Non."
- "This type system est très garbage"
- "VALIDATED!" (like "DELETED!" but for schemas)
- "Meanwhile, in schema land..."
- "And then the validation EXPLODED"

### Documentation Style

Write like you're narrating a poorly animated Flash video about the apocalypse, but it's JSON schemas:

**Bad Example (too corporate):**

> "The Chez library provides comprehensive JSON Schema validation for Scala applications."

**Good Example (Le Chez approved):**

> "HOKAY so. You have ze JSONs. They need ze validation. Le Chez is here, smoking contemplatively, ready to judge your schemas. Some of them will explode. C'est la vie."

## Visual Identity

### Colors

- **Cheese Yellow**: #F4D03F (the cheese)
- **Existential Blue**: #3B5F7F (the background)
- **Smoke Gray**: #E8E8E8 (the contemplation)
- **MS Paint Black**: #000000 (the outlines)

### Design Principles

1. Looks like it was drawn in MS Paint at 3am
2. Deliberately crude pixel art
3. Unnecessary animation potential (even in still images)
4. Smoking implements are mandatory
5. Speech bubbles with impact font energy

## Marketing Positioning

### Tagline Options

- "Le Chez: Your schemas are probably wrong"
- "Validated to death since 2024"
- "But I am le tired of bad schemas"
- "Swiss precision (with holes)"

### How to Talk About Features

**Type Safety:**
"Your types can't escape Le Chez. They will be VALIDATED. Some will survive. Others... non."

**Performance:**
"Fast like cheese rolling down a hill. Except the cheese is smoking. And judging you."

**Developer Experience:**
"Le Chez makes schema validation so easy, even your schemas could do it. But they can't. Because they're schemas."

**Error Messages:**
"When your validation fails, Le Chez will be there. Smoking. Judging. Explaining what went wrong with unnecessary drama."

## Content Examples

### README Introduction

```markdown
# Chez

HOKAY. So. You're probably here because:

1. You have JSONs
2. They need validation
3. You heard about a smoking cheese that judges schemas

Le Chez is here. _[takes long drag]_ Let's validate some schemas.
```

### Feature Announcement

```markdown
## Le Chez v2.0: Now with MORE VALIDATION

What's new:

- Your schemas can now be EVEN MORE validated
- Le Chez smokes 20% more contemplatively
- New error messages that make LESS sense
- Performance improvements (the cheese rolls faster)

But seriously, we added OpenAPI support. Le Chez approves.
```

### Tutorial Style

```markdown
## Chapter 1: In Which Your Schema Gets Validated

HOKAY so imagine you have ze schema. It sits there. Being wrong.

Le Chez sees it. _[smoking intensifies]_

"Non," says Le Chez. "This schema... it has ze problems."

And then the validation BEGINS.

## Community Guidelines

When representing Le Chez:

1. Never explain the joke
2. Commit to the bit
3. MS Paint aesthetics are ALWAYS appropriate
4. Technical accuracy hidden under layers of absurdism
5. When in doubt, add more smoking cheese

## Legal Note

Le Chez is not actually French, not actually cheese, and definitely not giving medical advice about smoking. Your schemas, however, ARE being judged.
